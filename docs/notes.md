# HawkEye - Development Notes
## Hidden Application Weaknesses & Key Entry-point Yielding Evaluator

## Project Initialization [2024-12-19]

### Project Branding [2024-12-19]
- **Decision**: Project renamed to "HawkEye - Hidden Application Weaknesses & Key Entry-point Yielding Evaluator"
- **Rationale**: The name reflects the tool's keen vision for detecting security vulnerabilities and entry points in MCP deployments
- **Branding**: Hawk symbolizes sharp vision, precision, and vigilance - perfect for a security reconnaissance tool

### Design Document Analysis
- **Decision**: Analyzed comprehensive design document for HawkEye MCP security reconnaissance tool
- **Rationale**: Design document provides detailed specifications for network scanning, MCP detection, risk assessment, and reporting capabilities
- **Key Components Identified**:
  - Network scanning engine with TCP/UDP support
  - MCP-specific detection algorithms
  - CVSS-based risk assessment
  - Multi-format reporting (JSON, CSV, XML, HTML)
  - Comprehensive CLI interface

### Implementation Strategy [2024-12-19]
- **Decision**: Adopted 8-phase development approach with checkpoints
- **Rationale**: Phased approach ensures stable foundation before building complex features, with testing integrated throughout
- **Architecture**: Modular design following Python conventions with clear separation of concerns

### Task List Structure [2024-12-19]
- **Decision**: Created detailed task list with 8 phases, 25 checkpoints, and 95+ individual tasks
- **Rationale**: Granular task breakdown enables better progress tracking and dependency management
- **Dependencies**: Clear dependency chain ensures logical development progression
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests planned for each component

### Technology Stack Decisions [2024-12-19]
- **Language**: Python (following project conventions)
- **Configuration**: Pydantic BaseSettings for environment-based config
- **CLI Framework**: To be determined (likely Click or argparse)
- **Testing**: pytest with comprehensive test coverage
- **Packaging**: Standard Python packaging with requirements.txt

### Security Considerations [2024-12-19]
- **Decision**: Security-first approach with non-intrusive scanning methodology
- **Rationale**: Tool must be responsible and compliant with security policies
- **Key Features**:
  - Rate limiting to prevent network disruption
  - Minimal privilege operation
  - Comprehensive input validation
  - Audit trail generation
