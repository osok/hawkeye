3. **Time Constraints**: Specific start and end times
4. **Contact Information**: 24/7 emergency contacts
5. **Escalation Procedures**: Clear incident response chain

#### Authorization Verification

```bash
# Verify authorization before each scan
echo "Authorization verified for: $TARGET_NETWORK"
echo "Authorized by: $AUTHORIZED_BY"
echo "Valid until: $EXPIRATION_DATE"
echo "Emergency contact: $EMERGENCY_CONTACT"

# Log authorization details
python application.py audit-log \
    --action "scan_authorized" \
    --target "$TARGET_NETWORK" \
    --authorized-by "$AUTHORIZED_BY" \
    --expires "$EXPIRATION_DATE"
```

### Scope Management

#### Scope Validation

```bash
# Validate target is within authorized scope
python application.py validate-scope \
    --target 192.168.1.100 \
    --authorization-file auth.json

# Example authorization file
cat > auth.json << 'EOF'
{
    "authorized_ranges": [
        "192.168.1.0/24",
        "10.0.1.0/24"
    ],
    "excluded_ranges": [
        "192.168.1.1",
        "192.168.1.254"
    ],
    "authorized_by": "John Smith, CISO",
    "valid_until": "YYYY-MM-DDT23:59:59Z"
}
EOF
```

## Operational Security

### Secure Tool Deployment

#### Environment Hardening

1. **Isolated Environment**: Run HawkEye from dedicated security workstation
2. **Network Segmentation**: Use separate network segment for security testing
3. **Access Controls**: Implement strong authentication and authorization
4. **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive activity logging

#### Configuration Security

```yaml
# secure_config.yaml
security:
  audit_logging: true
  encrypted_storage: true
  access_control: strict
  network_isolation: true

logging:
  level: INFO
  audit_trail: true
  encryption: true
  retention_days: 90

authentication:
  require_2fa: true
  session_timeout: 3600
  max_failed_attempts: 3
```

### Credential Management

#### Tool Credentials

- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: Never embed credentials in configurations
- **Secure Storage**: Use encrypted credential stores
- **Rotation Policy**: Regularly rotate service accounts
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required permissions

#### Target System Access

- **Read-Only Access**: Use read-only credentials when possible
- **Temporary Accounts**: Create temporary accounts for assessments
- **Account Monitoring**: Monitor account usage during assessments
- **Cleanup Procedures**: Remove temporary accounts after completion

---

## Data Protection

### Scan Data Security

#### Data Classification

- **Highly Sensitive**: Vulnerability details, system configurations
- **Sensitive**: Network topology, service inventories
- **Internal**: Scan metadata, timing information
- **Public**: General methodology, tool information

#### Protection Measures

```bash
# Encrypt scan results
gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --compress-algo 1 --symmetric \
    --output scan_results.json.gpg scan_results.json

# Secure file permissions
chmod 600 scan_results.json.gpg
chown security:security scan_results.json.gpg

# Secure deletion of unencrypted data
shred -vfz -n 3 scan_results.json
```

### Data Retention

#### Retention Policies

- **Active Assessments**: Retain during assessment period
- **Completed Assessments**: Retain per organizational policy (typically 1-3 years)
- **Compliance Requirements**: Follow regulatory retention requirements
- **Secure Disposal**: Use secure deletion methods

#### Data Lifecycle Management

```bash
# Automated data lifecycle management
cat > data_lifecycle.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

# Archive old scan data
find /scan_results -name "*.json" -mtime +30 -exec gzip {} \;

# Move archived data to secure storage
find /scan_results -name "*.gz" -mtime +90 -exec mv {} /secure_archive/ \;

# Securely delete expired data
find /secure_archive -name "*.gz" -mtime +1095 -exec shred -vfz -n 3 {} \;
EOF
```

### Privacy Protection

#### Personal Data Handling

- **Minimize Collection**: Collect only necessary information
- **Data Anonymization**: Remove or mask personal identifiers
- **Access Controls**: Restrict access to authorized personnel
- **Consent Management**: Obtain consent where required

#### GDPR Compliance

```python
# Example privacy protection implementation
def sanitize_scan_results(results):
    """Remove or mask personal data from scan results"""
    sanitized = results.copy()
    
    # Remove personal identifiers
    if 'user_accounts' in sanitized:
        sanitized['user_accounts'] = ['[REDACTED]'] * len(sanitized['user_accounts'])
    
    # Mask IP addresses if required
    if 'internal_ips' in sanitized:
        sanitized['internal_ips'] = [mask_ip(ip) for ip in sanitized['internal_ips']]
    
    return sanitized
```

---

## Network Courtesy

### Rate Limiting

#### Conservative Defaults

```yaml
# Conservative scanning configuration
scanning:
  default_threads: 10
  default_timeout: 10
  rate_limit: 25
  retry_attempts: 2
  delay_between_requests: 100

network_courtesy:
  respect_robots_txt: true
  avoid_peak_hours: true
  monitor_impact: true
  emergency_stop: true
```

#### Dynamic Rate Adjustment

```python
# Monitor network impact and adjust rates
def monitor_network_impact():
    """Monitor network performance and adjust scanning rates"""
    response_times = measure_response_times()
    error_rates = measure_error_rates()
    
    if response_times > threshold or error_rates > threshold:
        reduce_scan_rate()
        log_impact_detected()
    
    return current_scan_rate
```

### Impact Minimization

#### Timing Considerations

- **Avoid Peak Hours**: Schedule scans during maintenance windows
- **Business Hours**: Respect business operational hours
- **Time Zones**: Consider global operations and time zones
- **Maintenance Windows**: Coordinate with system maintenance

#### Resource Management

```bash
# Resource-conscious scanning
python application.py scan \
    --target 192.168.1.0/24 \
    --threads 5 \
    --rate-limit 10 \
    --timeout 15 \
    --nice-priority \
    --monitor-impact
```
