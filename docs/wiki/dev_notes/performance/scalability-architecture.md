## Horizontal Scaling Strategies

### Batch Processing Architecture

**Large-Scale Optimization Framework**:

```python
@dataclass
class ScalingConfig:
    # Batch processing configuration
    enable_batch_processing: bool = True
    batch_size: int = 50
    max_batch_size: int = 200
    adaptive_batch_sizing: bool = True
    batch_timeout: float = 300.0  # 5 minutes per batch
    
    # Parallel execution
    max_workers: int = 10
    worker_scaling_factor: float = 1.5
    adaptive_worker_scaling: bool = True
    worker_timeout: float = 180.0  # 3 minutes per worker
```

**Key Horizontal Scaling Features**:

1. **Adaptive Batch Sizing**:
   - Dynamic batch size adjustment based on system load
   - Resource-aware batch creation (memory, CPU constraints)
   - Load-based optimization (10-200 servers per batch)

2. **Parallel Batch Processing**:
   - Concurrent batch execution using ThreadPoolExecutor
   - Configurable worker pool size (default: 10 workers)
   - Automatic load balancing across available workers

3. **Distributed Task Management**:
   - Independent batch processing with minimal coordination overhead
   - Fault isolation (batch failures don't affect other batches)
   - Result streaming for real-time processing

### Connection Pool Scaling

**Optimized Connection Pool Architecture**:

```python
@dataclass
class PoolOptimizationConfig:
    # Adaptive sizing
    enable_adaptive_sizing: bool = True
    min_pool_size: int = 2
    max_pool_size: int = 50
    target_utilization: float = 0.7  # 70% utilization target
    scaling_factor: float = 1.5
    
    # Load balancing
    enable_load_balancing: bool = True
    load_balance_strategy: str = "least_connections"
    health_check_interval: float = 30.0
```

**Scaling Characteristics**:
- **Dynamic Pool Sizing**: 2-50 connections based on demand
- **Target Utilization**: Maintains 70% pool utilization for optimal performance
- **Load Balancing Strategies**: Least connections, round-robin, weighted distribution
- **Health Monitoring**: 30-second health check intervals with automatic failover

### AI Provider Scaling

**Multi-Provider Load Balancing**:

```python
class EnhancedProviderSelector:
    selection_weights = {
        SelectionCriteria.COST_OPTIMIZED: {
            "cost": 0.4, "performance": 0.2, "quality": 0.2, "reliability": 0.2
        },
        SelectionCriteria.PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZED: {
            "cost": 0.1, "performance": 0.4, "quality": 0.3, "reliability": 0.2
        },
        SelectionCriteria.BALANCED: {
            "cost": 0.25, "performance": 0.25, "quality": 0.25, "reliability": 0.25
        }
    }
```

**Load Balancing Strategies**:
1. **Round Robin**: Equal distribution across providers
2. **Weighted Round Robin**: Performance-based distribution
3. **Least Connections**: Route to provider with lowest active requests
4. **Least Response Time**: Route to fastest responding provider

## Vertical Scaling Strategies

### Resource-Aware Scaling

**Resource Monitoring System**:

```python
class ResourceMonitor:
    def __init__(self, config: ScalingConfig):
        self.config = config
        # Resource thresholds
        self.max_memory_usage_mb = 1024  # 1GB
        self.max_cpu_usage_percent = 80.0
        self.resource_check_interval = 10.0
```

**Vertical Scaling Features**:

1. **Memory Management**:
   - Real-time memory usage monitoring
   - Automatic memory optimization based on load
   - Garbage collection optimization (70% efficiency)
   - Memory leak detection and prevention

2. **CPU Optimization**:
   - Dynamic thread pool sizing based on CPU load
   - Worker thread scaling (1.5x scaling factor)
   - CPU-aware batch size adjustment
   - Adaptive timeout management

3. **I/O Optimization**:
   - Connection pooling and reuse
   - Async I/O where applicable
   - Buffer management for high-throughput scenarios

### Adaptive Resource Allocation

**Dynamic Resource Adjustment**:

```python
def _calculate_optimal_batch_size(self, total_servers: int) -> int:
    """Calculate optimal batch size based on configuration and system resources."""
    batch_size = self.config.batch_size
    
    # Adjust based on total servers
    if total_servers > 1000:
        batch_size = min(self.config.max_batch_size, batch_size * 2)
    elif total_servers < 100:
        batch_size = max(10, batch_size // 2)
    
    # Adjust based on available resources
    current_usage = self._resource_monitor.get_current_usage()
    if current_usage['memory_percent'] > 70:
        batch_size = max(10, batch_size // 2)
    elif current_usage['cpu_percent'] > 70:
        batch_size = max(10, batch_size // 2)
    
    return min(batch_size, self.config.max_batch_size)
```

**Resource Adaptation Strategies**:
- **Memory-Based Scaling**: Reduce batch size when memory usage exceeds 70%
- **CPU-Based Scaling**: Throttle processing when CPU usage exceeds 80%
- **Network-Based Scaling**: Adjust connection pool size based on network latency
- **Disk-Based Scaling**: Optimize caching strategies based on disk I/O performance

## Load Balancing and Distribution

### Multi-Level Load Balancing

**Application Level Load Balancing**:

   - Worker health monitoring and automatic failover
   - Load-aware task assignment

3. **Connection Load Balancing**:

   - Health-based connection routing
   - Circuit breaker pattern for failed connections

### Advanced Load Balancing Strategies

**Intelligent Provider Selection**:

```python
def select_load_balanced_provider(self, selection_context: SelectionContext, 
                                load_balancing_strategy: str = "weighted_round_robin") -> ProviderSelection:
    """Select provider using advanced load balancing strategies."""
    
    if load_balancing_strategy == "round_robin":
        selected_provider = self._select_round_robin(available_providers)
    elif load_balancing_strategy == "weighted_round_robin":
        selected_provider = self._select_weighted_round_robin(available_providers, selection_context)
    elif load_balancing_strategy == "least_connections":
        selected_provider = self._select_least_connections(available_providers)
    elif load_balancing_strategy == "least_response_time":
        selected_provider = self._select_least_response_time(available_providers)
```

**Load Balancing Metrics**:
- **Connection Count**: Active connections per provider/worker
- **Response Time**: Average response time for load distribution
- **Success Rate**: Provider reliability for weight calculation
- **Cost Efficiency**: Cost per operation for economic load balancing

## Resource Management

### Comprehensive Resource Monitoring

**Real-Time Resource Tracking**:

```python
class ResourceMonitor:
    def _monitor_loop(self) -> None:
        """Main monitoring loop."""
        while self._monitoring:
            # Get current resource usage
            memory_usage = psutil.virtual_memory().percent
            cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1.0)
            
            # Record metrics
            self._resource_history.append({
                'timestamp': timestamp,
                'memory_percent': memory_usage,
                'cpu_percent': cpu_usage,
                'memory_mb': psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
            })
            
            # Check thresholds and generate alerts
            if memory_usage > 90.0:
                self._alerts.append(f"High memory usage: {memory_usage:.1f}%")
            if cpu_usage > self.config.max_cpu_usage_percent:
                self._alerts.append(f"High CPU usage: {cpu_usage:.1f}%")
```

    current = self.get_current_usage()
    return (
        current['memory_mb'] > self.config.max_memory_usage_mb or
        current['cpu_percent'] > self.config.max_cpu_usage_percent
    )
```
