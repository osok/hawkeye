## Risk Prioritization Algorithm

### Five-Step Process

The core `RiskPrioritizationAlgorithm` implements a structured five-step process:

1. **Technical Impact Score Calculation**
2. **Business Impact Assessment**
3. **Likelihood Evaluation**
4. **Environmental Modifiers Application**
5. **Final Priority Ranking Generation**

#### Algorithm Implementation

```python
def prioritize_threats(
    self,
    threat_analyses: List[ThreatAnalysis],
    tool_capabilities: List[ToolCapabilities],
    environment_context: EnvironmentContext,
    business_context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> List[PrioritizedThreat]:
    """
    Prioritize threats using the Risk Prioritization Algorithm.
    
    Process:
    1. Calculate technical impact score
    2. Assess business impact based on context
    3. Evaluate likelihood based on threat actor capabilities
    4. Apply environmental modifiers
    5. Generate final priority ranking
    """
```

### Scoring Weights Configuration

The algorithm uses configurable weights for different risk components:

```python
scoring_weights = {
    'technical_impact': 0.25,      # 25% - Technical severity and exploitability
    'business_impact': 0.35,       # 35% - Business consequences and costs
    'likelihood': 0.25,            # 25% - Probability of successful attack
    'environmental_factors': 0.15  # 15% - Environment-specific modifiers
}
```

### Priority Thresholds

Risk scores are mapped to priority levels using configurable thresholds:

```python
priority_thresholds = {
    PriorityLevel.CRITICAL: 0.85,  # 85-100% - Immediate action required
    PriorityLevel.HIGH: 0.70,      # 70-84% - High priority remediation
    PriorityLevel.MEDIUM: 0.50,    # 50-69% - Scheduled remediation
    PriorityLevel.LOW: 0.30        # 30-49% - Monitor and plan
    # Below 30% - Minimal priority
}
```

## Technical Impact Assessment

### Technical Impact Scoring Model

```python
@dataclass
class TechnicalImpactScore:
    """Technical impact assessment result."""
    vulnerability_severity: float      # 0.0-1.0
    exploitability_score: float       # 0.0-1.0
    attack_complexity: float          # 0.0-1.0 (inverted)
    privilege_requirements: float     # 0.0-1.0 (inverted)
    user_interaction: float           # 0.0-1.0 (inverted)
    scope_impact: float               # 0.0-1.0
    confidentiality_impact: float     # 0.0-1.0
    integrity_impact: float           # 0.0-1.0
    availability_impact: float        # 0.0-1.0
    overall_score: float              # Weighted combination
    scoring_rationale: str            # Human-readable explanation
```

### Technical Impact Calculation Process

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Threat Analysis] --> B[CVSS Scoring]
    A --> C[Exploitability Assessment]
    A --> D[Attack Complexity Analysis]
    A --> E[Privilege Requirements]

    B --> G[Vulnerability Severity Score]
    C --> H[Exploitability Score]
    D --> I[Complexity Score]
    E --> J[Privilege Score]
    F --> K[Scope Score]
    
    G --> L[Technical Impact Calculation]
    H --> L
    I --> L
    J --> L

### Business Impact Calculation

```python
@dataclass
class BusinessImpactScore:
    """Business impact assessment result."""
    financial_impact: float          # 0.0-1.0
    operational_impact: float        # 0.0-1.0
    reputational_impact: float       # 0.0-1.0
    compliance_impact: float         # 0.0-1.0

    'reputation_damage': 50000.0 # Estimated reputation cost (USD)
}
```

## Likelihood Evaluation

### Threat Actor Capability Assessment

The system models different threat actor types with capability scores:

```python
threat_actor_capabilities = {
    'script_kiddie': 0.3,              # 30% capability
    'cybercriminal': 0.6,              # 60% capability
    'insider_threat': 0.7,             # 70% capability
    'nation_state': 0.9,               # 90% capability
    'advanced_persistent_threat': 0.95 # 95% capability
}
```

### Likelihood Factors

        impact += 0.5  # High compliance requirements
    elif environment_context.data_sensitivity == DataSensitivity.CONFIDENTIAL:
        impact += 0.3
    
    # Industry context affects compliance obligations
    if business_context:
        industry = business_context.get('industry', '')
        if industry.lower() in ['finance', 'healthcare', 'government']:
            impact += 0.2  # Heavily regulated industries
