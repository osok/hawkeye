# Dynamic Threat Analysis Enhancement Design Document

## Executive Summary

This design document outlines the architecture needed to transform the current basic threat analysis output into a comprehensive, dynamically generated threat analysis report.

### Target State Requirements
- Detailed attack vector analysis with specific exploitation steps
- Code examples for attack scenarios
- Comprehensive abuse scenario modeling
- Attack chain analysis showing multi-step attack paths
- Risk-specific mitigation strategies
- Compliance impact assessment
- Executive summary with business impact

## Core Design Principles

1. **Zero Hardcoding**: All threat scenarios, attack vectors, and mitigations must be dynamically generated

3. **Context-Aware Risk Assessment**: Consider deployment environment, security posture, and compliance requirements
4. **Scalable Pattern Recognition**: Support for analyzing any MCP server configuration
5. **Evidence-Based Reporting**: All threats must be backed by actual discovered capabilities
