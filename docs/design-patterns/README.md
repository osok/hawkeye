# Design Patterns Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains detailed documentation of the design patterns used throughout the HawkEye MCP security reconnaissance tool. Each pattern is documented separately to provide reusable knowledge that can be referenced from the command-specific documentation.

## Pattern Documentation Structure

Each design pattern document follows a consistent structure:

### 1. Pattern Overview
- **Intent**: What problem does this pattern solve?
- **Also Known As**: Alternative names for the pattern
- **Motivation**: Real-world scenarios that led to using this pattern

### 2. Structure
- **UML Class Diagram**: Visual representation of the pattern
- **Participants**: Key classes/interfaces involved
- **Collaborations**: How participants work together

### 3. Implementation in HawkEye
- **Concrete Examples**: Actual classes from the codebase
- **Code Snippets**: Key implementation details
- **Variations**: How the pattern is adapted for specific needs

### 4. Analysis
- **Benefits**: Advantages gained from using this pattern
- **Drawbacks**: Trade-offs and potential issues
- **Performance Implications**: Impact on system performance

### 5. Related Patterns
- **Complementary Patterns**: Patterns often used together
- **Alternative Patterns**: Other solutions to similar problems

## Design Patterns Used in HawkEye

### 1. Abstract Base Class (ABC) Pattern
**File**: `abstract-base-class-pattern.md`
**Usage**: MCPDetector, BaseScanner, RiskAssessor, BaseReporter
**Purpose**: Defines common interface and shared behavior for polymorphic class hierarchies

### 2. Strategy Pattern
**File**: `strategy-pattern.md`
**Usage**: Detection strategies, Scanner types, Reporter formats
**Purpose**: Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms and makes them pluggable

### 3. Factory Pattern
**File**: `factory-pattern.md`
**Usage**: Pipeline creation, Transport factory, Reporter instantiation
**Purpose**: Creates objects without specifying exact classes, promotes loose coupling

### 4. Command Pattern
**File**: `command-pattern.md`
**Usage**: CLI command structure using Click framework
**Purpose**: Encapsulates requests as objects, supports queuing and undo operations

### 5. Template Method Pattern
**File**: `template-method-pattern.md`
**Usage**: Base classes with abstract methods and concrete implementations
**Purpose**: Defines algorithm skeleton, letting subclasses override specific steps

### 6. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
**File**: `chain-of-responsibility-pattern.md`
**Usage**: Detection pipeline, Assessment chain
**Purpose**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers until one handles it

### 7. Builder Pattern
**File**: `builder-pattern.md`
**Usage**: ReportData construction, PipelineConfig assembly
**Purpose**: Constructs complex objects step by step with flexible configuration

### 8. Adapter Pattern
**File**: `adapter-pattern.md`
**Usage**: Transport layers, MCP version compatibility, Legacy system integration
**Purpose**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together

## Cross-References

Each pattern document includes cross-references to:
- **Command Documentation**: Where the pattern is used in scan/detect/analyze-threats
- **Architecture Documentation**: How the pattern fits into the overall system
- **Code Locations**: Specific files and classes implementing the pattern

## Usage Guidelines

When working on the HawkEye codebase:

1. **Before Adding New Components**: Check if existing patterns can be extended
2. **When Modifying Existing Code**: Ensure pattern integrity is maintained
3. **During Code Reviews**: Verify pattern implementations follow documented structure
4. **For New Features**: Consider which patterns are most appropriate

## Pattern Evolution

As the codebase evolves, patterns may need to be:
- **Extended**: Adding new concrete implementations
- **Modified**: Adapting to new requirements while maintaining core structure
- **Refactored**: Improving implementation while preserving interface contracts
- **Deprecated**: Replacing with better alternatives when necessary

## Contributing

When updating pattern documentation:
1. Keep examples current with the codebase
2. Update UML diagrams when structure changes
3. Document any deviations from standard pattern implementations
4. Maintain cross-references to command documentation
